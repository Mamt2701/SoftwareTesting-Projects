## Introduction

Software testing is a critical part of the software development process. It ensures that applications function as expected and meet user needs. This repository provides a collection of projects that demonstrate various testing techniques and tools. 

## Projects Overview

### E-commerce Testing

In the E-commerce testing section, you will find detailed projects that focus on testing online shopping platforms. The projects utilize tools like **Jira** and **Xray** for bug tracking and test management. 

- **Test Cases**: We provide a comprehensive set of test cases covering functionalities like product search, payment processing, and user account management.
- **Documentation**: Each project includes detailed documentation that explains the testing process, tools used, and results obtained.

### Banking App Testing

This section covers testing for banking applications. The focus is on ensuring security, accuracy, and compliance with financial regulations. 

- **TestMonitor**: We use TestMonitor for managing test cases and tracking defects. 
- **Test Cases**: The test cases cover functionalities such as fund transfers, balance inquiries, and account management.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation is provided to guide you through the testing process.

### API Testing

API testing is crucial for ensuring that services communicate effectively. This section focuses on testing APIs using **Postman**.

- **Test Cases**: You will find test cases that validate API endpoints, response formats, and error handling.
- **Documentation**: Each API project includes documentation that explains the endpoints tested, the methods used, and the expected outcomes.

## Testing Techniques

In this repository, we explore various testing techniques to ensure quality assurance. These techniques include:

- **Black Box Testing**: Focuses on testing the application without knowledge of internal code structure.
- **White Box Testing**: Involves testing internal structures or workings of an application.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Testing without a formal test plan, allowing testers to explore the application freely.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensures that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionalities.

## Test Cases

Test cases are essential for structured testing. In this repository, we provide:

- **Detailed Test Cases**: Each project includes a list of test cases with descriptions, expected results, and actual results.
- **Traceability Matrix**: A matrix that maps test cases to requirements, ensuring complete coverage.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is vital for understanding the testing process. Each project includes:

- **Setup Instructions**: Step-by-step guides to set up the testing environment.
- **Execution Steps**: Clear instructions on how to execute test cases.
- **Results**: Documentation of test results, including any defects found and their resolutions.
